## Installation
---
- Pull repo from github, run "npm i" to install the required dependencies, run "npm run start". Your browser should automatically start up the application with the running code. 

## Usage
---
- The calculator is set up to handle almost every basic operation including: (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, decimal, square root, exponential). To ensure smooth usage, make sure to "clear" when starting a brand new calculation. It currently has the ability to take your end result and continue casting operations on it but at the moment, It <u>cannot</u> handle negative number mathematics. If you generate a negative number, you are encouraged to clear and start again. I plan to add the functionality in future developments!

## Reflection
---
- This project was challenging and incredibly fun to figure out. As a recent bootcamp graduate, it posed as a very solid learning experience and as an eye opener to certain aspects of JavaScript and React that I needed to brush up on. I have more ideas of how to create this application if I were to start over as well as where I need to improve on. Just knowing how much I was able to learn and implement in such a small amount of time genuinely excites me for the years to come as I continue to develop and tread new grounds as a developer. I apprecaite this opportunity and look forward to more thrilling challenges to come!
